In this chapter, we will explore the significance of building cross-functional teams and discuss strategies for their effective formation and management.

**Understanding Cross-Functional Teams**

Cross-functional teams are composed of members from different functional areas within an organization, such as marketing, finance, operations, and design. By bringing together individuals with diverse skill sets and knowledge, cross-functional teams foster creativity, collaboration, and a broader perspective on problem-solving.
